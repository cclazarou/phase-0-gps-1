#Git concepts that were a struggle for me#
1. diff between fetch/merge and pull
2. cleaning up after commiting to the wrong branch
3. best practices for submitting collaboration during pairing

#Concepts clarified during GPS#
1 and 3

#Questions posed#

Pair

- What are best practices for commit messages?
- What is your method of dealing with committing to the wrong branch?
- What was your path to dev bootcamp?
- How "in my lane" would you prefer me to stay in our roles of navigator and driver?

Guide

I can't remember the questions I posited to the guide.  I remember that most of the time she jumped when she intuited that we were stuck on a problem for too long.

#Still Confusing#
- Best practices for dealing with committing to the wrong branch

Everything else I have questions about are less confusing and more just "un-looked up by me".  Looking forward to fleshing out my understanding with continued independent research.

#How was it#
It was great!  I like pairing in general, and Jake was a really communicative and friendly pair.  It was really helpful to have Jaimie step in when we were stuck, and she was good assessing when leaving us to our troubleshooting process was more helpful.
