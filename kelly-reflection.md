# Reflections
- What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

  -Mostly just merge conflicts, but also the difference between pull and fetch/merge

- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

  -Definitely conflicts, pull vs fetch/merge is making sense and will make more sense the more I use it.

- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

  -A lot about pull vs. fetch/merge, otherwise not a lot.

- What still confuses you about Git?

  -It all seems pretty clear to me at this point.  There's always more to learn, but I think I have a good operating knowledge.

- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

  -It was great! It went a little longer than the allotted one hour, but I was able to continue on and complete the challenge with my pair after our guide left(she stayed with us for more than the hour).
